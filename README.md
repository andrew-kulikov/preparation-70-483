All themes that should be covered according to official Microsoft exam specification (covered themes will be maked with ✅):

1. ✅ Manage Program Flow (25-30%)   
  1.1. Implement multithreading and asynchronous processing.    
    Use the Task Parallel library, including the Parallel.For method, PLINQ, Tasks;create continuation tasks;
    spawn threads by using ThreadPool; unblock the UI; use async and await keywords; manage data by using
    concurrent collections   
  1.2. Manage multithreading    
    Synchronize resources; implement locking; cancel a long-running task; implement thread-safe methods to
    handle race conditions   
  1.3. Implement program flow   
    Iterate across collection and array items; program decisions by using switch statements, if/then, and
    operators; evaluate expressions   
  1.4. Create and implement events and callbacks  
    Create event handlers; subscribe to and unsubscribe from events; use built-in delegate types to create
    events; create delegates; lambda expressions; anonymous methods  
  1.5. Implement exception handling

    network timeout exceptions; use catch statements; use base class of an exception; implement try-catchfinally blocks; throw exceptions; rethrow an exception; create custom exceptions; handle inner exceptions; handle aggregate exceptions
2. Create and Use Types (25-30%)  
  2.1. Create types  
    Create value types, including structs and enum; create reference types, generic types, constructors, static
    variables, methods, classes, extension methods; create optional and named parameters; create indexed
    properties; create overloaded and overriden methods  
  2.2. Consume types  
    Box or unbox to convert between value types; cast types; convert types; handle dynamic types; ensure
    interoperability with unmanaged code that accesses COM APIs  
  2.3. Enforce encapsulation

  2.4. Create and implement a class hierarchy  
    Design and implement an interface; inherit from a base class; create and implement classes based on the
    IComparable, IEnumerable, IDisposable, and IUnknown interfaces  
  2.5. Find, execute, and create types at runtime by using reflection  
    Create and apply attributes; read attributes; generate code at runtime by using CodeDom and lambda
    Lambda expressions; use types from the System.Reflection namespace, including Assembly, PropertyInfo, MethodInfo, Type  
  2.6. Manage the object life cycle  
    Manage unmanaged resources; implement IDisposable, including interaction with finalization; manage
    IDisposable by using the Using statement; manage finalization and garbage collection  
  2.7. Manipulate strings  
    Manipulate strings by using the StringBuilder, StringWriter, and StringReader classes; search strings;
    enumerate string methods; format strings; use string interpolation    
3. Debug Applications and Implement Security (25-30%)  
  3.1. Validate application input  
    Validate JSON data; choose the appropriate data collection type; manage data integrity; evaluate a regular
    expression to validate the input format; use built-in functions to validate data type and content   
  3.2. Perform symmetric and asymmetric encryption  
    Choose an appropriate encryption algorithm; manage and create certificates; implement key
    management; implement the System.Security namespace; hashing data; encrypt streams  
  3.3. Manage assemblies  
    Version assemblies; sign assemblies using strong names; implement side-by-side hosting; put an assembly
    in the global assembly cache; create a WinMD assembly  
  3.4. Debug an application  
    Create and manage preprocessor compiler directives; choose an appropriate build type; manage
    programming program database files and (debug symbols)  
  3.5. Implement diagnostics in an application  
    Implement logging and tracing; profiling applications; create and monitor performance counters; write to
    the event log  
4. Implement Data Access (25-30%)  
  4.1. Perform I/O operations  
    Read and write files and streams; read and write from the network by using classes in the System.Net
    namespace; implement asynchronous I/O operations  
  4.2. Consume data  
    Retrieve data from a database; update data in a database; consume JSON and XML data; retrieve data by
    using web services  
  4.3. Query and manipulate data and objects by using LINQ  
    Query data by using operators, including projection, join, group, take, skip, aggregate; create methodbased LINQ queries; query data by using query comprehension syntax; select data by using anonymous
    types; force execution of a query; read, filter, create, and modify data structures by using LINQ to XML  
  4.4. Serialize and deserialize data  
    Serialize and deserialize data by using binary serialization, custom serialization, XML Serializer, JSON
    Serializer, and Data Contract Serializer  
  4.5. Store data in and retrieve data from collections  
    Store and retrieve data by using dictionaries, arrays, lists, sets, and queues; choose a collection type;
    initialize a collection; add and remove items from a collection; use
